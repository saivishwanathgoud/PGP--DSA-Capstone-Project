Insurance Renewal Propensity
It is a challenging time for financial services institutions in the insurance domain due to increased pressures from regulatory bodies, customers and the broader socio-economic climate. Losses due to premium payment delays and ultimately default results in huge revenue losses to insurance companies since premium revenue is the top source of income for these organizations.
Data Science and predictive modelling in particular provide these organizations tools to proactively work out the issue of premium default by identifying customers who are most likely to default; accessing the factors that affect customer churn and then based upon these revelations work out the strategies and tactical changes needed to avert and reduce the loss due to premium default.
The findings from this study are based on the premium dataset that was made available by the insurance company. This data has around 80,000 observations containing sixteen predictor/ independent variables and one target/ response/ dependent variable. This data is a mix of continuous and categorical variables and does not contain any missing or null values. Results from exploratory data analysis shows that there exists high standard deviation in terms of age, premium and income. Also, there is evidence of skewness and presence of outliers in the dataset.
